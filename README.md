hard-drive-tracker-app
======================

Simple Hard Drive Tracker App using Angular.js &amp; Firebase, for The Monkey's Cobbler.

Built from the [[angular-seed project|https://github.com/angular/angular-seed.git]]

Todo
----
*  Firebase is unnecessary: instead, should switch to a local database, perhaps sqlite or something. Or jsut even a flat json.txt file that I read in/out?!
*  Name the hard drives
*  Give an image to the hard drives also?
*  Ability to edit the names of the hard drives / edit hard drive notes
*  Ability to edit an event, after it's been created
